<h1 style="border:2px solid mediumseagreen;">Image Distortion</h1>
<p><b>Image distortion can serve as a powerful metaphor for perception and truth. When an image is altered, stretched, blurred, or warped, it challenges our sense of what is real and forces us to question the reliability of what we see. In art and photography, distortion can express emotion, memory, or subjective experience, revealing that reality is often filtered through personal interpretation. Distortion also highlights the limitations of cameras and screens. This reminds us that every image is a translation, not a perfect mirror. Lastly distortion causes us to consider how easily appearances can shift, and how meaning depends not just on what is shown, but on how it is shaped.</b></p>

<h2 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Aesthetic Not Failure</h2>
<p><i>On the same line of distortion. Aesthetic Not Failure is intentional distortion; an artistic decision to either produce distortion or choose not to fix distortion. The distortion becomes a part of the artwork. Such as with glitch art or poor quality image and evokes different or deeper level of emotion than a perfectly "aesthetic" piece of work.</i></p>
