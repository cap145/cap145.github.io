        <img src="Headshot.JPEG" height="500" width="370"> <p>My name is Chloe Petty. I am an art student at UWF. On this webpage you will find a showcase of my net art. In my intro page you will find two paragraphs dissecting aesthetic failure and distortion. Along with a poor image of a little person dressed as a clown smoking a cigarette. My second piece of net art I wanted to make a gif exploring my facial expressions with the painting tool in photoshop. And lastly I showcased my html abilities in the echo page by echoing the entire Intro page.
